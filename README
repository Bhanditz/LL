Yet another Arc web thing.

This makes use of a number of hacks to the arc interpreter and core libraries (under the "hacks" and "lib" directories).
These are in the form of patches to arc, which must be applied as directed in main.hack, and straight replacements of arc core library files, which are in the lib directory.
LL requires arc 3.1 and git.
